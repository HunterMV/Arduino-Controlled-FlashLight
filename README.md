# Arduino-Controlled-FlashLight
This is a very simple little project to help build my skills in both the development process of software and hardware. 
# Project Goal
To create a flashlight that can be turned on and off remotely or iterate through a number of different functions, i.e. light flashing, light on/off and more. 
# Idea Behind Project 
I came up with the idea for this project after playing a tag like game with my fiancee and her two little sisters. The game was me and my fiancee hiding with all the lights in the house off and waiting for her sister to walk by with a flashligh. We would then try to scare them in diffrent ways. While this game was fun for everyone I thought it could be made more fun if the hiders could turn on or off the finders flashlight, I thought the best way to do this would be to put an Ardunio inside of a flashlight body and use bluetooth to control it.  

The bluetooth plan didn't end up working out in the prototype I made, most parts didn't end up working in the prototype. But that will be addressed more in the prototype build section. This really isn't a complex project, the complex part will be implementing all of the features I want in a fun way. I am looking at this project as if I am making an actual toy.
